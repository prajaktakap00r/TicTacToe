# Project Description

- Developed a classic Tic Tac Toe game using React.
- Aimed to practice and improve skills in React and state management.
  
### Objective:

- Create an interactive, user-friendly Tic Tac Toe game.
- Enhance understanding of React components, hooks, and props.
  
### Features
#### Gameplay:
- Two-player mode where players take turns.
- Real-time updates to the game board.
- Immediate feedback for winning or draw situations.
- User Interface:
- Clean and intuitive UI design.
- Responsive layout that works on various screen sizes.
- Highlighting the winning combination.
#### Game Logic:

- Efficient handling of game state using React hooks.
- Checking for win conditions and draw scenarios.
- Restart game functionality.
- 
### Technical Stack
#### React:

- Utilized React functional components.
- Managed state using the useState and useEffect hooks.
- Component-based architecture for modularity.
#### Styling:

- CSS for styling components.
- Flexbox/Grid for layout management.
####  Development Tools:

Leveraged VS Code for development and debugging.
Code Structure
Components:

Board Component: Renders the game board and manages game state.
Square Component: Represents individual squares on the board.
Game Component: Main component handling the game logic and UI.
State Management:

State variables for tracking the game board, current player, and game status.
Functions to handle player moves and check game status.
Hooks:

useState for managing the state of the board and player turns.
useEffect for any side effects, such as checking win conditions.
Challenges and Solutions
State Management:

Solution: Implemented a function to check all possible win combinations after each move.
Responsive Design:

Challenge: Ensuring the game is playable on different screen sizes.
Solution: Used responsive CSS techniques and media queries.
Learning Outcomes
